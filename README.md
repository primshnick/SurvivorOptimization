# SurvivorOptimization
NFL Survivor Optimization. Collaboration with Zach Samuels.

Survivor is NFL betting game where each week, one winner among all the teams playing is selected. The goal is to maximize how many weeks you choose a winning team. However, a team can only be used once. 

This workbook, and attached VBA macros, use simulated annealing optimization to choose the optimal winner choice for each week to maximize various objective functions, which can be selected by the user.
